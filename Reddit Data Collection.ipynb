The reason is very simple - the person determining the truth must enter the inquiry with an open and detached mind .

      "I‚Äôm sorry but i feel that there is a need for the cop to do this. Im a millenial, and i think all millenials knows that decisions -&gt; actions -&gt; consequences/responsibilities. Non of which RK has ever thought of, because if she had, she wouldnt have lied, not once, not twice, but thrice. Now maybe even the fourth. The generation nowadays are taught that if you are not caught, you are not liable to consequences after, ie, they live by, do but dont get caught rule. You have so many lying around, eg. Ralph wee, and more that i couldnt think of at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. RK lied in parliament for a notion. RK is an mp, ie. public figure. If she was let away easily, what would it look like in the public‚Äôs eyes. I believe she is well liked by the women‚Äôs support group and has garnered the new generation‚Äôs support cause she‚Äôs what u would all say ‚Äòwoke‚Äô. Has ideas and likes to sound them out. Hence, she lied to substantiate a notion which was weak, til she said she accompanied one. \n",

      "2. Ive watched the entire cop meetings and felt the initial part of every cop started off well, until pap couldnt get the answers they wanted from the workers party, then it usually leads to questioning as if it was a court proceeding regarding why RK lied. He say, she say, everything give PS say. Hence the situation now, theyre just making RK an example of what would happen if you lied but it just seems that she keeps thinking she is able to get away again by lying. Knowing that she is smart in her own ways, she used mental health/issue as another reason again. She is just an example of who we see in ns. But now its in a public platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alas, i think there are much more to say la. But it just seems like she isnt on good terms with PS alr, if she just took the bullet and said everything was her fault, i believe it would have ended. Now it just helped pap with another step forward and 10 steps backward for the worker‚Äôs party, like what someone said here. Its really pretty sad considering how well most of the leaders of wp stood against questionings by strong professionals  in their field. \n",

      "PS bringing up TT is a cunning attempt to distract from RK case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two issues are fundamentally different:\n",
      "1. VB believes the information that he said to be true at that point of conveying, this is consistent with the wordings at TT app where it was explicitly stated that it will only be used for contact tracing purpose. Although, it was proven to be false, there is no INTENT to deceive and he is misinformed and incompetent at worst. Contrast this with RK case, she knows her account is not truthful and she convey it with the INTENT to deceive. This is criminal and breach of parliamentary privilege, she is LYING. That‚Äôs why there is no COP for VB case but there is one for RK case.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. PAP and WP are both in the wrong when they know that something is wrong and they have made a lousy move by being slow in conveying the truth. But the real question here is: does the delay arose from intention to TELL but just finding the right timing or intention to CONCEAL. TT case resurfaced because PAP OWN MP CDS asked parliamentary question on it, their own mp and they checked and come clean that they are wrong (not sure what WP MP is doing (sleeping with eyes open maybe?), but in this case RK confession came after repeated pressing by SK, one ought to wonder if SK did not press on it, will this matter ‚Äúbe brought to grave‚Äù and never resurfaced, that‚Äôs the question and what COP is investigating. RK lies is not the crux of investigation, this is established fact, she has pleased guilty, if she and the other wp member never brought up the possible complicity of WP leaders, this would have ended in 1 sitting.\n",

      "1.It was the right thing to conduct the COP as it was the only way to hold  RK accountable for her lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.COP should assume she would do everything and say anything to lessen her responsibility since  she was now in hot soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.COP should never have released the interim report as this gave all the WP leaders valuable information on what they would be questioned.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "5.If indeed WP leaders have told her to \"take the lie to the grave\" , their contradicting testimonies, timelines etc would have been revealing as they would have been caught off guard.\n",
