      "\n",
      "1) The public nature and the fact that parliamentarians have to be the one doing this of course puts up lots of visible air time but that does not imply other priorities are forsaken - just like in the private sector there are always people doing the real work while leaders are there for direction and final decisions\n",

      "There is merit in investigating the circumstances surrounding the lies, but the way the COP was conducted is clearly not the best way to reach an objective conclusion. I can understand its partisan composition given that it is a by-product of the lopsided numerical advantage PAP has in Parliament, but the difference in the manner of questioning was quite stark.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For PS, the questions asked heavily presupposed a certain narrative and focused on what PS *should* have done, while yesterday RK was mostly just asked if she agreed or disagreed with PS, SL and FM and after she disagrees, no follow-up. Don’t get me wrong, I am not asking for PS to be questioned less intensely than RK, but to be seen as fair notwithstanding its partisan composition, there needs to be parity of standard of questioning by the COP.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the COP reaches a conclusion that prefers RK’s account, I can already see what’s going to happen. The handful of pro-PAP accounts that are so heavily invested in this saga and became overnight crusaders for accointability will go around flooding the boards and blast their narratives as the objective truth with the backing of the COP’s legitimacy. And diehard WP ppl will cast doubt on the COP’s findings without even reading, given ET’s line of questioning suggesting a pre-conceived version of events. \n",

Anything is possible but we’ve heard enough and no more reliable evidence is likely to emerge. At this stage it’s simply not a priority to continue banging on about it, unless your actual priority is to grab hold of anything you can to drag the oppositions name through the mud for as long as possible for purely political reasons.

Non of which RK has ever thought of, because if she had, she wouldnt have lied, not once, not twice, but thrice. Now maybe even the fourth. The generation nowadays are taught that if you are not caught, you are not liable to consequences after, ie, they live by, do but dont get caught rule. You have so many lying around, eg. Ralph wee, and more that i couldnt think of at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. RK lied in parliament for a notion. RK is an mp, ie. public figure. If she was let away easily, what would it look like in the public’s eyes. I believe she is well liked by the women’s support group and has garnered the new generation’s support cause she’s what u would all say ‘woke’. Has ideas and likes to sound them out. Hence, she lied to substantiate a notion which was weak, til she said she accompanied one. \n",

      "2. Ive watched the entire cop meetings and felt the initial part of every cop started off well, until pap couldnt get the answers they wanted from the workers party, then it usually leads to questioning as if it was a court proceeding regarding why RK lied. He say, she say, everything give PS say. Hence the situation now, theyre just making RK an example of what would happen if you lied but it just seems that she keeps thinking she is able to get away again by lying. Knowing that she is smart in her own ways, she used mental health/issue as another reason again. She is just an example of who we see in ns. But now its in a public platform. \n",

TT case resurfaced because PAP OWN MP CDS asked parliamentary question on it, their own mp and they checked and come clean that they are wrong (not sure what WP MP is doing (sleeping with eyes open maybe?), but in this case RK confession came after repeated pressing by SK, one ought to wonder if SK did not press on it, will this matter “be brought to grave” and never resurfaced, that’s the question and what COP is investigating.

I hope someone's life can be ruined by this weekend so that i can sleep happy. \n",

      "Here are some different perspectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.It was the right thing to conduct the COP as it was the only way to hold  RK accountable for her lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.COP should assume she would do everything and say anything to lessen her responsibility since  she was now in hot soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.COP should never have released the interim report as this gave all the WP leaders valuable information on what they would be questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.Without any knowledge about what RK had testified, there would have been a higher chance to reveal the truth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5.If indeed WP leaders have told her to \"take the lie to the grave\" , their contradicting testimonies, timelines etc would have been revealing as they would have been caught off guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.Equally true if their testimonies was similar to the actual one that they gave, then one could be sure that RK had just told another bombshell lie to shift away blame from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that was needed was for the COP to do their investigation out of the public eye. No videos  testimony should have been released until the report was finalized. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end this has become an unnecessary saga where the truth is lost forever \n",
      "\n",
      "RK: you should believe me because I have a mental health condition\n",
      "\n",
      "RK: as someone that was once sexually assaulted, I can confirm that the allegations were true and thus should be believed\n",
      "\n",
      "also RK: as a woman....\n",
      "\n",
      "???? \n",
      "\n",
      "just reading OP I can hear his/her ideal WP world crumbling. I feel sorry thar you have held PS and gang to such a high ideal that now the fall is extra painful for you. like one of the witnesses, Ms Loh, your world is being shattered and one natural response is to run away from it. \n",
      "\n",
      "this is the exact reason the COP exists and why this inquiry exists: to ensure no one runs away, gets away when shit hits the fan. its a thankless job but its one they are tasked to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "WP dug its own grave. the COP is merely placing a sign there that says \"danger. avoid at all costs\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly tho what do you think the wp could get by lying instead of telling the truth? Assuming that they want to lie maliciously instead of sitting on it and admittedly making a mistake.\n",
      "Uh, oh, oh, someone is upset... :-(\n",
      "\n",
      "Suck it up, buttercup. It's not only about Raeesah but about integrity of the parliamentary chamber and representatives of the nation. That she lied we already knew - but other people may have been involved in perpetuating the lie for political gain or, at the very least, with an aim of saving themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a serious matter for any democratic nation and if you don't want to follow it because it puts your idols in a bad light, cracking your lifelong belief in a particular party, then perhaps politics isn't for you in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sheer fact that RK was caught lying once does not mean she's lying all the time - and the obvious inactivity of the party leadership, along with 10 hours spent by Pritam religiously dodging one question after another, failing to give straight answers, only reinforces the notion that WP leaders may be guilty of more than just incompetence.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they have all brought it onto themselves. They could have solved the problem back in August or September, clarifying the story with or without Raeesah, coming clean before it spiralled out of control. \n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't and the public deserves to know what the truth is, even if you don't like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "COP occupies just a few MPs out of ca. 100. The executive branch, the administration, civil service, police, healthcare et al are all unaffected by occasional hearings in a case that would be treated with the same seriousness everywhere else in the civilized world. \n",

      "\n",
      "*dusted off my degree, finally i can put it to good use*\n",
      "While that's true, we need to let the COP complete the report to send a message that lies within parliament is unacceptable. Given the need for increased transparency, they have to publish video proceedings of the meetings. So, at the end of the day, it's a matter of if you don't want it, don't watch it. Also, ministers aren't in the COP and neither is most of the executive branch, so this is more of an instance where the govt is walking and chewing gum simultaneously. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gna be interesting to see how this unfolds. At this point in time it’s just he said she said. Don’t really know where they can progress with this. Unless new evidence surfaces, which I doubt. Unfortunately for RK she doesn’t appear to have high credibility.. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of it was just her lying and resigning, it would have ended le. But RK wanna drag down the whole WP down with her so no choice, must continue. Anyway, our government isn't dropping all the other stuff to settle RK case so I don't really know what u getting at. \n",
      "\n",
      "You might be done but not we are. Not until we use this case as a nail for WP coffin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I just don't get what's up with RK and why she's dragging the rest of WP into this. Things would be simpler if she just owned up to her lying and took responsibility. All her bs insisting about \"PS told her to take it to the grave\" and whatnot, it really looks like she just wants to shift the blame. Like some employee, after  a wrongdoing she says it's her manager's fault, but no it's not her fault at all because her manager should have stopped her like wtf?? Why would anyone ever tell her to lie in parliament?? That has no benefit to anyone in the party??? \n",
      "\n",
      "Does she have no sense of loyalty or responsibility at all?? She literally just backstab WP for no comprehensible reason. I dk who would even want to hire her after this. \n",

      "Honestly I hate the COP, I hate how much of a circus this has become. It’s so fucking obvious she’s been lying and lying about how she perpetuated the lie but somehow we dedicate hours and air time to this. I can’t for the life of me see how hard earned taxpayer’s money should be dedicated to this drawn out shenanigans. She lied, she adversely affected how the public would respond if a woman reported a sexual assault case, she obviously does not feel responsible, but wronged? \n",
