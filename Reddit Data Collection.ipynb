      "1) The public nature and the fact that parliamentarians have to be the one doing this of course puts up lots of visible air time but that does not imply other priorities are forsaken - just like in the private sector there are always people doing the real work while leaders are there for direction and final decisions\n",

      "There is merit in investigating the circumstances surrounding the lies, but the way the COP was conducted is clearly not the best way to reach an objective conclusion. I can understand its partisan composition given that it is a by-product of the lopsided numerical advantage PAP has in Parliament, but the difference in the manner of questioning was quite stark.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For PS, the questions asked heavily presupposed a certain narrative and focused on what PS *should* have done, while yesterday RK was mostly just asked if she agreed or disagreed with PS, SL and FM and after she disagrees, no follow-up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not asking for PS to be questioned less intensely than RK, but to be seen as fair notwithstanding its partisan composition, there needs to be parity of standard of questioning by the COP.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the COP reaches a conclusion that prefers RK‚Äôs account, I can already see what‚Äôs going to happen. The handful of pro-PAP accounts that are so heavily invested in this saga and became overnight crusaders for accointability will go around flooding the boards and blast their narratives as the objective truth with the backing of the COP‚Äôs legitimacy. And diehard WP ppl will cast doubt on the COP‚Äôs findings without even reading, given ET‚Äôs line of questioning suggesting a pre-conceived version of events. \n",
