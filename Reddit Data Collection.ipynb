The difference is that you have an impartial judge adjudicating and deciding who is more likely to be telling the truth. Then you have (an obviously partial) lawyers doing the cross-examination. The reason is very simple - the person determining the truth must enter the inquiry with an open and detached mind . It is a trite legal proposition that a judge may be found to have \"descended into the arena\" if he/she asks too many questions in a manner which disrupts the proceedings or which gives an appearance that he/she is prejudging the matter.\n",

The generation nowadays are taught that if you are not caught, you are not liable to consequences after, ie, they live by, do but dont get caught rule. You have so many lying around, eg. Ralph wee, and more that i couldnt think of at the moment.\n",

I believe she is well liked by the women’s support group and has garnered the new generation’s support cause she’s what u would all say ‘woke’. Has ideas and likes to sound them out. Hence, she lied to substantiate a notion which was weak, til she said she accompanied one. \n",

      "2. Ive watched the entire cop meetings and felt the initial part of every cop started off well, until pap couldnt get the answers they wanted from the workers party, then it usually leads to questioning as if it was a court proceeding regarding why RK lied. He say, she say, everything give PS say. Hence the situation now, theyre just making RK an example of what would happen if you lied but it just seems that she keeps thinking she is able to get away again by lying. Knowing that she is smart in her own ways, she used mental health/issue as another reason again. She is just an example of who we see in ns. But now its in a public platform. \n",

      "1. VB believes the information that he said to be true at that point of conveying, this is consistent with the wordings at TT app where it was explicitly stated that it will only be used for contact tracing purpose. Although, it was proven to be false, there is no INTENT to deceive and he is misinformed and incompetent at worst. Contrast this with RK case, she knows her account is not truthful and she convey it with the INTENT to deceive. This is criminal and breach of parliamentary privilege, she is LYING. That’s why there is no COP for VB case but there is one for RK case.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. PAP and WP are both in the wrong when they know that something is wrong and they have made a lousy move by being slow in conveying the truth. But the real question here is: does the delay arose from intention to TELL but just finding the right timing or intention to CONCEAL. TT case resurfaced because PAP OWN MP CDS asked parliamentary question on it, their own mp and they checked and come clean that they are wrong (not sure what WP MP is doing (sleeping with eyes open maybe?), but in this case RK confession came after repeated pressing by SK, one ought to wonder if SK did not press on it, will this matter “be brought to grave” and never resurfaced, that’s the question and what COP is investigating.

      "\n",
      "1.It was the right thing to conduct the COP as it was the only way to hold  RK accountable for her lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.COP should assume she would do everything and say anything to lessen her responsibility since  she was now in hot soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.COP should never have released the interim report as this gave all the WP leaders valuable information on what they would be questioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.Without any knowledge about what RK had testified, there would have been a higher chance to reveal the truth.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5.If indeed WP leaders have told her to \"take the lie to the grave\" , their contradicting testimonies, timelines etc would have been revealing as they would have been caught off guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.Equally true if their testimonies was similar to the actual one that they gave, then one could be sure that RK had just told another bombshell lie to shift away blame from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that was needed was for the COP to do their investigation out of the public eye. No videos  testimony should have been released until the report was finalized. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end this has become an unnecessary saga where the truth is lost forever \n",

I'm thinking they took a gamble and it crashed. perhaps WP always set high standards for PAP and saw themselves checking on the incumbent, but failed to remember that the very standards they set also apply to themselves.

      "The sheer fact that RK was caught lying once does not mean she's lying all the time - and the obvious inactivity of the party leadership, along with 10 hours spent by Pritam religiously dodging one question after another, failing to give straight answers, only reinforces the notion that WP leaders may be guilty of more than just incompetence.\n",

      "While that's true, we need to let the COP complete the report to send a message that lies within parliament is unacceptable. Given the need for increased transparency, they have to publish video proceedings of the meetings. So, at the end of the day, it's a matter of if you don't want it, don't watch it. Also, ministers aren't in the COP and neither is most of the executive branch, so this is more of an instance where the govt is walking and chewing gum simultaneously. \n",
